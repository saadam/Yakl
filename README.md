Yet Another KeeperRL Launcher

Need .Net 8.0 and Windows.

Launcher tries to use default paths (eg. Steam etc.). If KeeperRL cannot be found in standard paths then user need to set path to KeeperRL manually. 
Launcher lists all local mods and remote mods. If there is newer version available then it is marked by * and can updated by Update button. If mod is not downloaded locally - launcher can download mod from github by Download button.
